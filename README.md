This repository contains a handout for a seminar talk about the quantum group $`\mathrm{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)`$.
This talk was part of a *Graduate Seminar on Representation Theory* about [*Hopf algebras and tensor categories*][1] at the University of Bonn in the winter term of 2019/20.
Since the talk some typos and minor mistakes have been fixed.
In case of further typos or mistakes please contact me at `stelzner@uni-bonn.de`.
